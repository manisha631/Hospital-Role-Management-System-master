# Hospital-Role-Management-System
Part-1
The reason behind choosing this topic is, as everyone knows that it is the time of covid pandemic, hosiptal management plays important role in every place, so we chose this.
Ok when it comes to authorisation and authentication, though docotors are experts in their field, they might not be able to handle the authorisation 
whatever the reasons it is like may be they were busy or lack of knowldege on security , we managed to add an admin role in our topic which has two user and performs the actions 
like to whom the acess should be given, till what extent the access should be given and also for verying the users before giving the access
